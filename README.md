# Marketing Demo

This repository contains the Snowflake based LookML, for both the model and dashboards, for demonstrating Lookerâ€™s ability to provide value within the digital marketing landscape.


## How to Use
If you are a Looker partner, please reach out to your analyst for access to dummy data. If you are an internal Looker user, please submit a helpdesk ticket to get credentials to the demo database.

#### Standard Users
**Option 1) Cloning from this repository:**
Do this if you want to stay up-to-date on changes to the model and do not plan on customizing for your own needs. See steps [here](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/getting-started/create-projects#clone_repo).

#### Advanced Users
**Option 2) Project import (preferred):**
Do this if you want to extend the model and make changes within your Looker instance. Existing LookML will still be available to view. Follow these steps [here](https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/importing-projects).

**Option 3) Duplicating this repository:**
Do this if you want to make your own copy of the model to directly modify within your Looker instance. Follow these steps, or download the files [here](https://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/09/12/moving-one-git-repo-into-another-as-subdirectory/) and upload into your own github repository within the UI.
